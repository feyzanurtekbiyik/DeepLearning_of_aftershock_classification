The BC model is built on a basic artificial neural network architecture that takes only 6 basic stress tensor components as input. The input data of the model was subjected to standardization (normalization) before training; thus, each feature was transformed so that its mean was zero and its standard deviation was one.

2. BC-E (Binary Classification - Euclidean Distance)
The BC-E model is an artificial neural network model trained with a total of seven input features, including the euclidean distance variable representing spatial proximity in addition to the basic stress components. All input data were normalized before the model; thus, each feature was brought to the same scale, and the stability of the model during the training process was increased.

3. BC-E-F (Binary Classification - Euclidean Distance - Face)
The BC-E-F model is an artificial neural network model trained with a total of 43 input features, including the basic stress components as well as the stress tensor components obtained from 6 neighboring grid cells overlapping on the surface plane. Thanks to this expanded input vector, the structural information of the central cell is not only limited to itself, but also the voltage relations with neighbors on the surface plane are integrated into the model. All input variables are normalized before the training of the model.

4. BC-E-F-P (Binary Classification - Euclidean Distance - Face - PCA)
In this model, in addition to the basic stress components and Euclidean distance information, stress tensor components obtained from neighboring grid cells on the surface plane are included. However, due to the high correlation and noise potential of these multidimensional inputs, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied as a dimensionality reduction method in the model. All tensor components belonging to the surface plane neighbors were normalized before PCA and then dimensionality reduction was performed by determining the most appropriate number of components according to the explained variance ratios.

5. BC-E-FE (Binary Classification - Euclidean Distance - Face Edge)
This model is an artificial neural network model trained with a total of 115 input features, including the basic stress components as well as the stress tensor components obtained from 6 neighboring grid cells overlapping on the surface plane and 12 neighboring grid cells overlapping on the edge plane. Thanks to this expanded input vector, the structural information of the central cell is not limited to itself, but also the voltage relations with neighbors on the surface and edge plane are integrated into the model. All input variables are normalized before the training of the model.

6. BC-E-FE-P (Binary Classification - Euclidean Distance - Face Edge - PCA)
In this model, in addition to the basic stress components and Euclidean distance information, stress tensor components obtained from neighboring grid cells on the surface and edge plane were included. However, due to the high correlation and noise potential of these multidimensional inputs, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied as a dimensionality reduction method in the model. All tensor components belonging to the surface and edge plane neighbors were normalized before PCA and then dimensionality reduction was performed by determining the most appropriate number of components according to the explained variance ratios. The final input vector of the model was created by combining the normalized basic features (6 stress components and distance) with the neighboring cell information that had undergone PCA transformation. Thus, the model was made sensitive to both the direct observation point and the environmental stress environment.

7. BC-E-FEC (Binary Classification - Euclidean Distance - Face Edge Corner)
This model is an artificial neural network model trained with a total of 163 input features, including the basic stress components as well as the stress tensor components obtained from 6 neighboring grid cells overlapping on the surface plane, 12 overlapping on the edge plane, and 8 overlapping on the corner plane. Thanks to this expanded input vector, the structural information of the center cell is not limited to itself, but also the stress relationships with neighbors on the surface and edge plane are integrated into the model. All input variables are normalized before training the model.

8. BC-E-FEC-P (Binary Classification - Euclidean Distance - Face Edge Corner - PCA)
In this model, in addition to the basic stress components and Euclidean distance information, stress tensor components obtained from neighboring grid cells on the surface, edge and corner planes were included. However, due to the high correlation and noise potential of these multidimensional inputs, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied as a dimensionality reduction method in the model. All tensor components belonging to the surface and edge plane neighbors were normalized before PCA and then dimensionality reduction was performed by determining the most appropriate number of components according to the explained variance ratios. The final input vector of the model was created by combining the normalized basic features (6 stress components and distance) with the neighboring cell information that had undergone PCA transformation. Thus, the model was made sensitive to both the direct observation point and the environmental stress environment.

9. BC-E-FE-SO (Binary Classification - Euclidean Distance - Face Edge - Oversampling)
This model is an artificial neural network model trained with a total of 115 input features, including the stress tensor components obtained from 6 neighboring grid cells overlapping on the surface plane and 12 neighboring grid cells overlapping on the edge plane, in addition to the basic stress components. Thanks to this expanded input vector, the structural information of the center cell is not limited to itself, but also the stress relations with neighbors on the surface and edge plane are integrated into the model. All input variables are normalized before training the model. This expanded input vector is rebalanced with the oversampling method in order to reduce the negative effect of data with unbalanced class distribution on learning. The data set is expanded by taking random repetitions from minority class (cells with aftershocks) samples in the training data, thus increasing the representation power of the positive class.

10. BC-E-FE-SU (Binary Classification - Euclidean Distance - Face Edge - Undersampling)
This model is an artificial neural network model trained with a total of 115 input features, including the basic stress components as well as the stress tensor components obtained from 6 neighboring grid cells overlapping on the surface plane and 12 neighboring grid cells overlapping on the edge plane. Thanks to this expanded input vector, the structural information of the center cell is not limited to itself, but also the stress relations with neighbors on the surface and edge plane are integrated into the model. All input variables are normalized before training the model. The imbalance observed between the classes in the data set is addressed at this stage with the undersampling method. In this context, the samples belonging to the majority class are reduced and a more balanced training set is created with the minority class. Thus, the model's ability to distinguish between classes is tried to be increased.

11. BC-E-FE-SO-D (Binary Classification - Euclidean Distance - Face Edge - Oversampling - Distance)
In this model, basic stress components, Euclidean distance information calculated from the center and stress tensor components derived from neighboring cells on the surface plane were used together. However, at this stage, a certain distance filter was applied to the dataset with the assumption that samples that are closer to the location of the aftershocks in terms of distance would make a more significant contribution to the model. After testing various threshold values, only samples located closer than a certain distance to the epicenter were included in the model. Thus, observations that were farther away and probably had weak aftershock characteristics were excluded from the model. This time, the class imbalance in the dataset was addressed with the oversampling method. In this context, samples containing aftershocks were randomly multiplied and thus the minority class was strengthened. Then, all input features were normalized and a common-scale training matrix was created.

12. BC-E-FE-SO-D-X (Binary Classification - Euclidean Distance - Face Edge - Oversampling - Distance - XGBoost)
In this model, instead of deep neural networks, the XGBoost classifier, which consists of gradient boosting-based decision trees, was used to estimate aftershocks. The model input includes the basic stress tensor components, the Euclidean distance information to the epicenter, and the stress values ​​derived from neighboring cells on the surface plane. However, since this multidimensional and complex structure can add noise to the model, especially for points far from the epicenter, only the observation cells close to the epicenter were filtered and included in the model.
Since there was a class imbalance in the dataset, the data was balanced by randomly multiplying the samples of aftershocks, thus ensuring that the classification performance became sensitive to the positive class. Then, all input variables were standardized to prevent scaling differences from disrupting model learning.
In the learning process of the model, XGBoost's tree-based structure was used and the model established a separation structure based on information gain that optimizes node divisions within itself. In this model, many hyperparameters such as the depth of decision trees, learning rate, number of estimators, gamma value (penalty to prevent complex divisions), subsample and colsample rates were automatically adjusted with the Bayesian optimization method. Thus, the model was configured with parameter combinations that would maximize the ROC AUC score in the validation data.
